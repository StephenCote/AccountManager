Security as a BioHazard

While sketching out some security concepts involving multiple datacenters, SaaS, and cloud providers, I started to notice a trend: The flows, with some imagination, looked a lot like a biohazard symbol. That was a rather stark reminder that, to paraphrase Bruce Schneier, security involves people.  My knee-jerk reaction was to mutter, of course, identity is yesteryear's new security boundary.  Yet, there it stared, nagging me: BioHazard.  And, I started to wonder, what if we were looking at this all wrong?  In a landscape of boundary onions, it seems like our cyber security infrastructures are a never-ending series of frustrating checkpoints, not too disimilar from TSA lines.  Sure, it's faster with the TSA equivalents, such as PreCheck, or Clear, and one day it will be really fast once Lasik gets involved (I.E.: Whatever you're planning on doing).  Meanwhile, none of those examples stop emotionally compromised or infectious individuals from sharing their distress in an enclosed space.  And, in the realm of cyber security, none of our boundaries are designed to inhibit those same compromising individuals (and, by infectious, I don't mean malware, but the very minds that would compose such).

Cyber Security is likened to physical security, authentication to checkpoints and forms of identification.  Meanwhile, computer systems are treated as the targets of malware infection, and users to social engineering.  At the root though (there's my bad pun for this discussion) the issue seems to be the wrong individuals obtaining the wrong access to the wrong resources at the wrong times for the wrong reasons, or the opposite of Identity and Access Management.  For the rest of the world, that's the opposite of ethics. Good IAM is, by that description, good ethics.  And, in practice, it tends to look like a never ending TSA line. Just as we are inclined to draw real world relationships to digital concepts, what if we did the reverse and consider our real world lives as a physical representation of our digitized processes and procedures? They don't seem very healthy anymore.

What if Identity and Access Management, in addition to being thought of in terms of ethics, was also thought of in terms of health? I don't mean only in terms of social media health, or risk health, but overall well-being.  My digital identity as an identity being.  My first inclination on drawing that comparison is to think: We're all running around unvaccinated; we are a digital biohazard.

But, first things first: Who am I as a digital being?

I'm a bunch of attributes, vaguely humanish I suppose, that have been broadcast, and shared, and blogged, and emailed, and breached all over the place. Every time I go anywhere on the internet, it seems about as orderly as a trip to the land-fill: I pay my entry fee and unload all the crud I decided to pack into my vehicle on that trip.  Then all the garbage gets shovelled around, moved around, into big stinking mounds of trash, shuttled and shipped and trucked and trained all over the world where it's sifted and sorted and burned and scavenged. And then I go home, feeling a tiny bit better about myself because I paid to unload some trash, and, elsewhere, someone is making a mountain of money off that trash.

Wait - let's go back to the beginning.

I'm a person.  I came from somewhere.  I have attributes that define me.  Those attributes and their values were instilled by my parents, they were taught to me in schools and churches, by the military, during employment, from friends and peers, and by strangers or random events.  Sometimes, some of those attributes are compromised by one of those sources.  Sometimes, they are removed, and not by choice.  And, ideally, those attributes are reviewed by different types of professionals who have studied those attributes and understand the complexities of how those attributes interact with the rest of the world.  My cholesterol attribute is too high.  Some people impose their attributes on others and that's called a crime, and they are prevented from attribute imposition for a while.  Others do the same pursuant to some generally agreed upon reason, such as in enforcement of legal code.  Others do the first but avoid preventative measure because they have the ability to compromise the second.  But at the end of the day, I have a certain amount of freedom regarding my attributes and their values, and how those attributes are used in my day to day life.

What I don't have, and most of us don't have, are myriad copies of ourselves with varying attribute compositions.  We have different moods, different wardrobes, different dispositions, but they are all the same set of attributes, just with different preferences applied in different circumstances.  Generally, when everyone is being civil and healthy around each other, we manage to get by.  Not everyone or everywhere, sadly, but mostly.   And, if someone with a raging and highly contagious case of the bubonic plague gets in line behind you, hey, that's all kopacetic, right, because, I don't know, freedom?  And, it's perfectly ok to walk around your neighborhood and pick your neighbor's flower attributes off their porch because they're just laying out there for everyone to see and grab anyway, right?  No, you would tell Mr. Black Death to get the heck away from you and probably call security, who would probably call the CDC, and quarantine that person.  Or your neighbors might break out the pitch forks, march right over to your house, and rip their wilted and poorly-planted pluckings right from your sticky fingers, and afterwards keep you at arm's length.

So what is missing in relating digital identities back on our physical selves?

The ability to individually release and retract our attributes ourselves, the ability of those around us to react to those released attributes, and the ability of those who operate our digital highways and gates to exercise some quality control, or, depending on the severity, a lot of quality control, on those attribute values.  Don't want to loan out that email attribute anymore?  Take it back (or the authorization to use it).  Has that attribute been vaccinated?  No?  Go get treatment (validation, verification, and certification) and try again.  Since everyone's information is already out there anyway, and privacy momentarily aside, what's missing is the ability to authorize access to and use of those attributes.  I can only ever be in one place at any given time (geolocation), drive one car (device) at any given time (yes, yes, everyone has a pocketful of phones nowadays), and I can identify myself by a combination of factors that usually include spot verification (biometric) of issued identification (driver's license, passport, etc), and, later, forge my parent's signature, I mean, sign my name, on the bar tab.  And I can take those things to a predetermined location, such as the DMV, or the TSA line, or the bouncer outside the mosh pit that serves organic tea (geolocation 2).  There are a number of ways to combine these different factors into likely verification of identity, and none of them involve people asking for a passphrase like I'm slipping into a speakeasy, or taking off my pants and submitting to a body cavity search of my attributes.  Once I perform the context-sensitive authentication of my being, and, possibly, some additional verification depending on what's happening, I'm still in complete control of my attributes and their values.  Then, later, when I leave, I take my attributes with me, and if I happen to have forgotten one or two, I tend to return on short notice to retrieve them.  All that's left is an audit trail that I, a being of some kind, had access to a resource at a particular time and, if appropriate, for a specific reason.

Why, then, digitally, do we rely on creating copies of everything? The answer isn't necessarily in any particular technology or pattern (though I can already hear echos of blockchain-this, or cloud-that, or federate-you); An essential tenet needs to be enforceable: People have to be able to exercise tight control over their attributes, and other people shouldn't need to hold onto those attributes any longer than is needed.  It's not only inappropriate, it's the kind of thing that should only be done behind closed doors.  I can verify myself with a social security number, or a drivers license number, or a passport number,  because I lend an authorization assertion to verify it.  At what point does having the actual value serve a purpose?  Isn't the value really in verifying that I am the  in the first place, and that the value itself is both value
